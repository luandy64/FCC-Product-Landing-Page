## Day 6: 6/18/18

### Today's Progress:
Created this repo, fixed CSS for the navbar

### Reflection:
I knew I wanted to use Flexbox to format everything for this site instead of
using Bootstrap. Thankfully after a bit of review of Flexbox from CreativeBloq
I was able to get the nav bar to look the way I want.

The colors might be the colors I want though.

I also learned that `<ul>` have some default padding, which confused me for a
while because I was seeing this space that I couldn't account for when I added a
border to everything.

### Next Step:
I need to add some media queries to make the nar bar responsive. I've decided on
`600px`, `900px`, and `1200px` as my breakpoints after reading an article on 
Medium.
