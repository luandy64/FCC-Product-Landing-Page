# 100 Days of Code Log

## Day 6: 6/18/18

### Today's Progress:
Created this repo, fixed CSS for the navbar

### Reflection:
I knew I wanted to use Flexbox to format everything for this site instead of
using Bootstrap. Thankfully after a bit of review of Flexbox from CreativeBloq
I was able to get the nav bar to look the way I want.

The colors might be the colors I want though.

I also learned that `<ul>` have some default padding, which confused me for a
while because I was seeing this space that I couldn't account for when I added a
border to everything.

### Next Step:
I need to add some media queries to make the nar bar responsive. I've decided on
`600px`, `900px`, and `1200px` as my breakpoints after reading an article on 
Medium.


## Day 16: 06/28/18

### Today's Progress:
* Moved off of Codepen
* Set up local deployment with Jekyll
* Figured out how to override the default layout and theming
* Picked a new color scheme, but it might not stick

### Reflection:
My decision to use Flexbox instead of Bootstrap is slowly me down significantly
I believe. The main issue is that in Bootstrap I can quickly make things fluid
and resize as needed, but I'm having trouble figuring that out with Flexbox.

Having read `Responsive Web Design` by Ethan Marcotte, I feel the need to make
a mockup of the site first, measure everything in pixels, and proceed from
there. I think that would greatly help with my palette choice as well. 

I also went through the freeCodeCamp Sass curriculum today. I thought it would
give me enough knowledge to deal with the Sass file in the Jekyll theme; 
however, for that file, I just needed to create another file of a similar name
and I could fill it however I want.

### Next Step:
Either figure out how to make the navbar fixed at the top- the example I looked 
up today did not do it for me. Or work on making the entire site responsive and
test it with `div`'s as placeholders.


## Day NUM: 06/29/18

### Today's Progress:
* Switched to a mobile-first approach
* Got to a good (working) draft of the mobile site; for a 320px wide viewport

### Reflection:
Today was quite a bit of confusion that turned into a victory as a result of
a breakthrough in understanding. 

An issue I was having was trying to reconcile having the fixed navbar and make
that work with the CSS grid somehow. I definitely lacked a clear understanding 
of how to use the CSS grid; however, after reading `[1]`, things made enough 
sense for me to ask my own questions and google what I wanted to do.

As evidenced by the notes I take on my process of designing this site, I jump
between designing the Desktop view and the Mobile view too often. While it is
helpful for me to know what I want the end product to look like, I was pretty
lost as far as approaching the implementation. Do I write the larger site first
and then use media queries to force smaller versions of it to look good? Do I
start small and go up from there? Is there a right way? Is there a wrong way?

The breakthrough for this came from watching another developer work. Namely, I
was inspired by `[2]`. I don't remember if Brad (TraversyMedia) answered any of
the questions I had. While I was watching the video however, I kept thinking,
"Oh, I know how to do that" and "That makes sense". So I gained the 
self-confidence that no matter what approach I take in implementing this site,
I can do it.

It's not the prettiest thing right now. I'll fix the styling for sure, but this
has been a great learning day!
